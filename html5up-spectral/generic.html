								<p>Born in 2004, I was prematurely birthed. According to my parents I was blue and on the verge of death. This is that dudes comeback story. I learnt guitar at the age of 13, and gained an interest in reading and fine arts before that. I have played almost every sport that I have come across and dabbled in all forms of performing arts as well. Now in university, time is spent learning all I can in my field of architecture and honing all the abilities I have gained in my previous years. I believe in friendship and forgiveness and hard work is above all else necessary.</p>

								<p>In things I believe myself worthy of being called, I would like to say I really do work hard. Whether it is to correct something or to get something done. Communication I think is also key, whether it is in the conceptual stages or the smoothening of the final stages, I know how many different ways something can be spoken. People must be treated as individuals and for that knowing who is at the other end of the phone is important. Being a musician helps in this aspect for I could make someone feel emotions without speaking a word. I get the job done and I'll learn new ways in the process to make sure the vision i envisioned is perfect. </p>
